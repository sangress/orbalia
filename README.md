**Brief**: Orba, master of Orbalia galaxy is sick. Would you help? If you agree you will need to feed Orba with green orbs collected from the "Voluptuous flower" - the Voluptuous flower spawns white orbs, once shoot at the white orbs they spawn green orbs. Make sure it goes to Orbalia's mouth. Be careful from the white orbs and don't shoot the flower. Good luck adventurer!
